In this project, I explored the relationship between personality traits and financial behavior by combining two datasets: one containing psychological profiles and another detailing asset holdings in various currencies. I found that risk tolerance followed a normal distribution, peaking around 0.5, suggesting that most individuals are moderately comfortable with risk. Interestingly, confidence, composure, and risk tolerance were strongly correlated, indicating that people who are more composed also tend to be confident and more open to taking risks. In contrast, impulsivity and impact desire didn’t show meaningful links to other traits or to financial outcomes.

When looking at asset values, I was surprised to find that none of the personality traits strongly predicted how much wealth a person held. The highest correlation—between impact desire and asset value—was still very weak and negative. Currency-wise, holdings were fairly balanced across the sample, but JPY asset values stood out as significantly higher than all others, hinting at possible institutional investment or regional factors influencing asset concentration.

To deepen the analysis, I used KMeans clustering to group individuals based on personality. These three behavioral clusters showed distinct currency preferences, suggesting that psychological profiles may influence not only how people manage wealth, but also which regions or currencies they favor. For example, one cluster leaned more heavily into USD and EUR, while another appeared more diversified across AUD and JPY—implying potential regional or risk-based investment strategies shaped by personality.

Finally, when grouping individuals by their risk tolerance levels, I found that those in the lowest risk quartile actually held the most wealth. This finding challenges the assumption that higher risk tolerance always translates into higher returns, at least within this sample. The person with the highest total assets in GBP had a risk tolerance score of 0.555, close to the overall average—highlighting that wealth and personality don’t always move in lockstep.
