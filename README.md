## Summary of Insights

### Personality & Risk
- Risk tolerance is normally distributed and peaks around 0.5
- Confidence, composure, and risk tolerance are **highly positively correlated** (r > 0.5)
- Impulsivity and impact desire are relatively independent

### Assets & Currency
- JPY asset values are **significantly higher** than other currencies
- Currency distribution is balanced across the dataset

### Personality vs Wealth
- No strong correlation between personality traits and total asset value
- Impact desire has the strongest (though weak) negative relationship (r ‚âà -0.07)

### Extended Analysis
- **Behavioral clusters** (via KMeans) show different currency preferences
- **Low risk tolerance** individuals hold **higher asset values** on average
